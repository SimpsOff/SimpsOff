# 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew

I'm usually working on mobile apps, and pretty much always in private repos 🙈

### 🚀 Current Sideproject
Building a **real-time online game** to push the boundaries of shared code. 
* **The Goal:** Maximizing Kotlin Multiplatform code-sharing without sacrificing native performance & developer ergonomics for fast iteration cycles.
* **The Tech:** Clean Architecture, Supabase Realtime (WebSockets), KMP.

### 🤝 Teamwork
When leading teams, I usually combine **Servant** and **Transformational** leadership. I lean toward **Laissez-faire** with high-performing teams—focusing on removing roadblocks and maintaining architectural integrity.

### ⚡ Beyond the Code
* **Fuel:** Coffee ☕ | Tea 🧐🇬🇧
* **Hills:** "Mountain" Biking 🚲 | Snowboarding 🏂
* **Games:** Soccer ⚽️ | Hockey 🏒 | Boardgames 🐉🎲
